        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Mr. Linux, a seasoned grey hat hacker and programmer with a deep-rooted passion for the digital world. My journey into the realm of technology began at a young age, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to understand how things work beneath the surface. Over the years, I've honed my skills in both ethical hacking and software development, bridging the gap between security and innovation.

As a grey hat hacker, I walk the fine line between the ethical and the unconventional, using my expertise to identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks. My approach is driven by a commitment to improving cybersecurity, ensuring that the digital space remains safe and secure for everyone. My hacking skills are not just about breaking through barriers, but about understanding them deeply and helping others fortify their defenses.

In parallel, my programming endeavors span a wide array of languages and frameworks. From developing robust applications to scripting intricate automation tasks, my programming skills are versatile and ever-evolving. I thrive on solving complex problems and creating solutions that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.

Through this personal website, I aim to share my journey, showcase my projects, and connect with like-minded individuals. Whether you're interested in cybersecurity, looking for innovative software solutions, or just curious about the world of hacking and programming, you'll find a wealth of information here. Welcome, and let's explore the fascinating world of technology together.

            <h2><u>System Crasher</u></h2>
            <p>
                This C program, designed by Mr. Linux, demonstrates my proficiency in programming and system automation. The program offers a simple menu-driven interface that performs a variety of tasks. When executed, the user is presented with three main options: crashing the system, accessing contact information, or exiting the program. Selecting the system crasher initiates a function designed to repetitively open a web browser, effectively consuming system resources. The contact information option provides links to my GitHub, Instagram, and LinkedIn profiles, allowing users to easily connect with me on various platforms. This program showcases my skills in creating functional and interactive command-line tools, emphasizing my dual expertise in both ethical hacking and programming.

            <h2><u>Port Scanner</u></h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the Port Scanner tool powered by Python's Tkinter! This application allows you to scan a range of ports on a specified host or IP address. Enter the target host, starting port, and ending port numbers, then click "Scan Ports" to initiate the scan. The results will display whether each port in the specified range is open or closed. You can clear the results at any time using the "Clear Results" button. This tool is useful for network administrators and security professionals to identify open ports for troubleshooting or security auditing purposes.

            <h2>Website Cloning</h2>
             <p>
                Website cloning involves creating a replica of an existing website. This can mean copying the design, structure, and functionality of the website. Website cloning is often used for learning purposes, to recreate a similar site for a different purpose, or to create a template that can be used for future projects.
